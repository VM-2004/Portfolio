    <p class="fade-in-delay">
      I am a passionate Java Full-Stack Developer with skills in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Servlets, JSP,
      JDBC, MySQL, React, Angular, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I have developed projects like a Hostel
      Management System, LIC Management System, and AI Interview Mocker, which strengthened my ability to design and
      build efficient, user-friendly applications. I enjoy problem-solving, exploring new technologies, and I’m eager
      to apply my knowledge in real-world projects to grow as a professional developer.
